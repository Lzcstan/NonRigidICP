As you can see from the reconstruction results the average morphing
error is fairly small. The greatest surface distance errors only
appear in the border areas of the unconnected patches (the STL demo
data was converted from IGES to STL where holes were introduced at
the patch boundaries). Due to the regularization the resulting
surface is smooth. Thus, in the border areas (where no ground truth
is available) the surface distance error should be in the same order
of magnitude as the remaining data.
